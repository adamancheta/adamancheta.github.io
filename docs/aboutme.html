        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> Here I wanted to explain a little bit more about myself. As I said I am from Hawaii, however, something that is interesting is that I was actually born on the mainland.
            I was actually born in Virginia, but my family moved to Hawaii because my dad is from there. Growing up in Hawaii has been an important part of my life. 
            In my family, I have my mom, dad, a younger brother, and an older brother. 
            One of the reasons I decided to attend Northeastern University is because my older brother already goes to school here. 
            I visited him during my junior year of high school, and I instantly fell in love with the campus and the atmosphere. That visit played a big role in my decision to apply.

            While I’m happy to be in Boston, I really miss home. Of course, I miss my family the most, but I also miss the beautiful weather, the beaches, and the constant sunshine. 
            Boston is amazing, but being here for about eight months out of the year has made me appreciate Hawaii even more. 
            I used to take things like surfing every day for granted, but now I realize how lucky I was. 
            Being able to spend so much time outdoors and enjoy the ocean is something I won’t ever overlook again when I’m back home.
